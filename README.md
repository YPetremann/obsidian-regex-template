# Obsidian Ruled Template

This is a plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md).

It permit to select a template on file creation based on rules.  
You can define as many rules as you need.  
You define for each rule a pattern (a regex or a glob) and a template to use.  
Rules are checked from top to bottom and the first to match is used.  
You can reorganise them as you like with convenient sorting arrows and quick deletion.  
You can also test rules by typing a path and it will tells you which one matched.
